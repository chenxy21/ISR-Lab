abstract: Conventional layered planning architecture temporally partitions the spatiotemporal motion planning by the path and speed, which is not suitable for lane change and overtaking scenarios with moving obstacles. In this paper, we propose to spatially partition the motion planning by longitudinal and lateral motions along the rough reference path in the Fren√©t Frame, which makes it possible to create linearized safety constraints for each layer in a variety of on-road driving scenarios. A generic environmental representation methodology is proposed with three topological elements and corresponding longitudinal constraints to compose all driving scenarios mentioned in this paper according to the overlap between the potential path of the autonomous vehicle and predicted path of other road users. Planners combining A* search and quadratic programming (QP) are designed to plan both rough long-term longitudinal motions and short-term trajectories to exploit the advantages of both search-based and optimization-based methods. Limits of vehicle kinematics and dynamics are considered in the planners to handle extreme cases. Simulation results show that the proposed framework can plan collision-free motions with high driving quality under complicated scenarios and emergency situations.
