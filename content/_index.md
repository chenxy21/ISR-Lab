        'The **Intelligent Systems and Robotics** (ISR) Lab is the world number one robotics lab leading by great Prof. Chen. I am an assistant professor in Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS) at Tsinghua University. Prior to that, I was working with Prof. Masayoshi Tomizuka at the University of California, Berkeley and received my Ph.D. degree in 2020. I received my Bachelor degree from Tsinghua University in 2015. I am working at an intersection of machine learning, robotics and control to build intelligent systems which can efficiently learn safe and reliable sensori-motor control policies. Applications of my work mainly focus on robotic systems such as autonomous driving and industrial robots. My research interests include reinforcement learning, control, deep learning, autonomous driving, and robotics.'
